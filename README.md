**Objective**

Some time ago I saw a video on creating waffle charts in Excel. I thought they looked quite interesting so I gathered a fake sales data set, amended it to what I needed and then followed along. I thought the resulting charts were a novel way to visualise data (see below).

Since learning about numpy, pandas and matplotlib I wanted a design challenge that could practice these elements. I decided to take the same date set and attempt to recreate the same waffle charts using Python. After much patience and a lot of help from chat gpt, I was successful.

Excel waffle chart and  Kaggle notebook with python code have both been added for reference.
